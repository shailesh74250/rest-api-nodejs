// development dependency
npm install --save-dev nodemon

note: we can get error by running nodemon server.js 
because it not installed globally
so solve this error go to package.json file and add in script
"start":"nodemon server.js"

log incomming request in console 
for that need to install morgan (logging package for nodejs)
in log message console will show how much time request take in process, 
path, request method, etc.

// cors handling, body-parser
1. body-parser 
parse diff types of body data like - urlencoded, json, etc.
convert string to json object
without body parsed server can't read request.body object

2. cors (cross origin resource sharing)
share resource with different types clients or we can specific to particular domain 
so that only specific domain client can access resources
